            <p>here is my review</p>
            <p2 class="text-muted text-left">Prithvi cafe, which was opened in the late 1970s is home to Prithvi theatre which is beloved by all those who appreciate art. As refreshing and soothing their cafe vibes are, the food does not disappoint at all!

                From - Prithvi Cafe, Mumbai

                On the table :
                ✨Veg Penne Arrabbiata = Rs 210
                ✨Hummus with Mushrooms = Rs 190

                Rating - 9.5/10

                #PrithviCafe is undoubtedly one of the best cafes in Mumbai. It's outdoor seating, colorful ambience, pocket friendly dishes and a unique vibe, makes it extremely popular amongst Mumbaikars!
                The #Pasta was served piping hot along with garlic bread, which was Perfecto! The #Hummus with Mushrooms, had a very authentic #flavour and definitely reminded me of Dubai! I also tried their Beer Bottle Chase and Cutting chai as well. Forgot to click pictures, but were equally superb!
                Just keep in mind that if you visit during rush hours, there'll be a waiting queue for sure. But on the bright side, there are also very high chances that you might run into a celebrity!</p2>

            <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <p>From the very first look at Marvel’s latest outing, it became apparent that there was something unique about ‘Thor: Ragnarok’. More vibrant than its two prequels, and combined with a quirky sense of humour, it reunites us with two larger-than-life superheroes – Thor and the Hulk, both of whom we haven’t seen since ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’ in 2015. From the outset, it’s evident how well these two play with, and against each other, continuing their love-hate bromance established in the first ‘Avengers’ film. Additionally, the film is infused with Taika Waititi’s trademark style of oddball comedy and while he plays wonderfully within Marvel’s sandbox, his imprint is evident in every frame and dialogue. Additionally, it translates very well on screen in all the performances from the ensemble cast.</p>

            <p>'Night at the Museum' is most certainly a crowd pleaser and with the action being fun enough to appeal to every member of the audience, it is a great family film.Parents need to know that Night at the Museum is a much-hyped, effects-heavy adventure that kids will definitely want to see. The effects are good (the dinosaur skeleton is especially fun), but the plot is uneven and the action hectic, with some point-of-view camerawork that could potentially startle younger viewers.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
